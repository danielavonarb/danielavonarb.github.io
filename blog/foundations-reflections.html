          I can't believe that the five weeks of foundations are already over! This time went by so very quickly and I feel 
          a bit sad about it. So let's reflect a bit on what we've learned in core each week.

        <h5>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h5>
          <ul class = "paragraph-list">
            <li>I didn't like spending so much time working 'on myself'. At least not at the beginning.
                I didn't want to think about my values, strengths and weaknesses.</li><br>
            <li>My values showed me why I was never happy in my previous job and that I'm on the right path now.</li><br>
            <li>It is very difficult not to compare myself to others and I have to constantly remind myself not to do it.</li>
          </ul>
        <h5>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h5>
          <p>
            It is important to know yourself in order to understand other people. 
            You need to be able to see things from your colleagues' perspective.
            Communication and kindness is key when working with others.
          </p>
        <h5>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h5>
          <ul class = "paragraph-list">
            <li>Knowing about neuroplasticity and growth mindset is life changing!</li><br>
            <li>There's so much to learn! We might think that we already know that stuff, that we know what it takes to be good person. 
                But you don't really know unless you're willing to spend some time self discovering.</li>
          </ul>
        <h5>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h5>    
          </p>
            To get over the awkwardness that I felt at the beginning and be willing to do some work on myself.
          </p>
        <h5>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h5>
          <p>
            Knowing and learning about yourself is very important. Especially in this intense learning context. 
            It will help us be kind to ourselves and others and it will help us understand our emotions. 
            Learning about neuroplasticity and growth mindset will set us up for success and will help us deal 
            with when we fall back to a fixed mindset.
          </p><br>
        <h5>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead?</h5>
          <p>
            The very first core exercise (the one about values etc) felt like a waste at the beginning :-) 
            But that's just because I didn't want to do it at first. I was so glad when I finally did it. 
            After that I really enjoyed the core part! And I even enjoyed the routine of writing blogs at the end of the week.
            It's a very nice habit that you had us built :-)
