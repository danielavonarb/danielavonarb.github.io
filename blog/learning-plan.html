      <div class = "blog-content__body" id = "div-with-border">
        <h4>Long term goal or career pathway</h4>
        <p>
          My goals haven't changed since the beginning of foundations.
        </p>
        <h4>Strengths and limitations in the learning context</h4>
        <p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p><br>
        <p>
          Another strength I've discovered is that I'm totally in the zone when I enjoy what I'm doing.
          I never felt like giving up during foundations. I loved doing the challenges.
        </p><br>
        <p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p><br>
        <p>
          I haven't really discovered any other limitations. My fluctuating self-esteem might get in the way on some days.
        </p>
        <h4>Human skills I would like to develop</h4>
        <p>
          This remains unchanged since the beginning of foundations. I also hope to be able to stop
          compare myself to others. And I would like to loose my worries about pair programming.
        </p>
        <h4>My commitment to how I will manage my workload and where and when to seek help</h4>
        <p>
          This also remains unchanged. But I really have to remind myself to do the daily medetation.
          During foundations I realised that I tend to forget about it when I'm super focused.
          I loose track of time when working on a problem. I want to set a timer going forward and reach out
          for help after 15 minutes.
        </p>
        <h4>What do I expect from the facilitation team</h4>
        <p id = "border-para">
          Pretty much the same as in foundations. I was very happy with the team and am sure
          that the support is going to stay awesome.

    <section class="intro">
      <h3 class ="section__title--intro">My Learning Plan for Foundations</h3>
      <div class = "blog-content__body">
        <p>I've committed to this journey. To hold myself accountable, I tried to write down my learning plan. It helps having your thoughts in writing. It makes them more real and you can always go back to them.</p>
        <h4>Long term goal or career pathway</h4>
        <p>My dream is to work as flexibly as I want. I want a career where it doesn't matter where in the world I'm located. I wish to have a career that provides me with lots of job opportunities no matter in which country I choose to live in. But most of all I want to have a sense of purpose, be happy with what I do and feel joy and satisfaction. I'm certain that the path I chose is the right one for me.</p>
        <h4>Strengths and limitations in the learning context</h4>
        <p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p><br>
        <ul class = "paragraph-list">
          <li>I'm very passionate if the subject grasps my interest. This is the first time I feel truly passionate about learning something new.</li><br>
          <li>I'm an empathizer. People tend to open up to me fairly quickly and turn to me if they need someone to talk to. I like to make sure that everyone feels included. I can also sense if someone isn't doing well and I will check up on them.</li><br>
          <li>I'm a self-believer. I don't think about what the future holds and know deep down that I will get through no matter what.</li><br>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p><br>
        <ul class = "paragraph-list">
          <li>I'm not good with conflicts. In fact, I try to avoid them. Sometimes I don't speak my mind just for the sake of peace. That's very frustrating.</li><br>
          <li>I'm an introvert. I have to work extra hard for my voice to be heard. Especially in groups with extroverts. I don't like being put on the spot. I need time for myself first to think about a topic.</li><br>
          <li>I have a fluctuating Self-Esteem. Some days I feel great about myself and feel very proud of my achievements. But every so often I have this inner voice telling me I don't have what it takes. I take criticism (not the constructive one) very hard and tend to believe the naysayers.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Human skills I would like to develop</h4>
        <ul class = "paragraph-list">
          <li>How to deal with conflicts. I know that conflicts aren't necessarily bad and I know that conflict is needed in order to grow as an individual or as a team. But I think I've just never been in an environment with high psychological safety.</li><br>
          <li>Learn to speak up for myself and make sure my voice is being heard.</li><br>
          <li>How to be part of a developer team and how to think more like a programmer.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>My commitment to how I will manage my workload and where and when to seek help</h4>
        <ul class = "paragraph-list">
        <li>I will treat this program like a job. It's what I've been doing so far. I get up at the same time every morning and do my morning routine. I start work at the same time every day. I have a great office setup at home which is a space I love being in.</li><br>
        <li>I will make sure to take enough breaks and go out for fresh air every day.</li><br>
        <li>If things start building up and are starting to get to me I will take a break and go for a quick walk. I will reach out to my husband or talk to some of my fellow students and will also reach out to my facilitator. I will also try to help other students if I sense that they are struggling.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>What do I expect from the facilitation team</h4>
        <ul class = "paragraph-list">
          <li>To create a safe environment for us where it is ok and encouraged to show some vulnerability and to ask for help.</li><br>
          <li>Maybe to have an extra ear open at the check-ins to listen for signs if someone is struggling but doesn't really speak it out.</li><br>
          <li>To talk about their own bootcamp experience and their struggles. It helps to hear it from other people who went through it and succeeded even though it was tough.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Blockout times</h4>
        <p>It's just my husband and I :-) So I don't really have other "responsibilities". I will blockout my lunch time and will try my hardest not to do any work during this time. And I don't want to start earlier than 8.30am so that I have the early mornings for myself to do yoga etc. </p>
