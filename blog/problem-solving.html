        <h4>Blocked on a simple problem</h4>
          <p>
            I was stuck on simple (and big) problems countless times during the last couple of sprints and can't think of a
            specific example ;-) But in all those cases I tried to apply a growth mindset and reminded myself that it's completely
            normal to get stuck. In fact, it's necessary in order to learn and grow. So, as a first step, I remained calm and told
            myself that it's fun to solve a problem and that I'm up for the challenge.
          </p><br>
          <p>
            As a second step, I thought about the different problem solving techniques. But I had to keep reminding myself of
            the growth mindset. There are times when my old mindset, the fixed one, creeps back. Especially when the challenges
            involve maths and logical thinking. Back in the days I used to feel stupid when it came to those things.
          </p><br>
          <p>
            I really enjoy the process of problem solving! I learn so much during the process and it feels amazing. Even if I can't 
            solve it. In those cases I'm telling myself that it's ok and that we probably haven't learned that yet. I still learned heaps
            along the way. And I practiced my problem solving skills.
          </p>
        <h5>My go-to problem solving techniques</h5>
        <ul class = "paragraph-list">
          <li><strong>Rubber ducky method:</strong> I usually start with talking the problem out loud. 
            This helps me think and articulate what I'm trying to do.</li><br>
          <li><strong>Pseudocode:</strong> After the rubber duck, I try to write simple pseudocode describing
             the main coding steps I'm trying to do.</li><br>
          <li><strong>Trying something:</strong> I try to think of a way to simplify the problem and try to get this to work.</li><br>
          <li><strong>CONSOLE.LOGGING:</strong> That's an important one! I do this all the time to be able to
             understand what the code is doing. I would be lost without it.</li><br>
          <li><strong>Googling & Youtube</strong> I google EVERY problem! But I realised that reading about something can be quite difficult. 
            Especially when reading the official documentation. It's so dry. I need visuals. That's why I go on youtube all the time and look up
            videos on the topic. For me personally this is the best way to learn about something. It helps having someone explain a topic while
            showing examples.</li><br>
        </ul>
        <h5>Techniques I'm not too confident with...YET</h5>
          <p>
            The following techniques I should get more confident with. I'm not used to reaching out for help. I like the challenge of being able
            to solve a problem on my own.
          </p><br>
          <ul class = "paragraph-list">
            <li><strong>Asking your peers for help:</strong> I need to do this more often. It's not only for my benefit but
              I'm giving someone else the chance to practice explaining something.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Asking coaches for help:</strong> I have the advantage of being married to an ex-developer :-) So if I'm super stuck I ask him for help.
              However, that doesn't help my fellow students. If I would ask the question to one of the coaches, their reply might help somebody else too. 
              I really want to reach out more often going forward.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>
            Problems and challenges are a good thing! They lead to learning and growth. Try out different problem solving techniques.
            Every problem might require a different technique. If you struggle with reading documentations, try watching a video instead.
            And never be afraid to ask for help!
